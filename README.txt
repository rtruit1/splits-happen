This is my second attempt at the problem. I went for a easier approach and left the computations in the main class itself.

I made two classes that I used to generate a LinkedList
	Frame: Class for LinkedList characters 
	Frame2: Class for LinkedList integers 
	
All other logic is handled in the main class, and should be pretty easy to read.
